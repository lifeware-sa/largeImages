# Large Image Support

This project includes a baseline to load a series of enhancements to Pharo. 
These enhancements provide a better user experience when coping with large images.
Large images are images with a lot of objects, this objects are not only objects representing our data 
but also it applies to images with a lot of code.

This baseline performs two diferent things:

1. It installs the following tools:

  - [Complishon](https://github.com/guillep/complishon) a new completion engine for Pharo that provides better contextual
  answers and it is implemented to minimize the queries to the global system. 

  - [Containers/CTTrie] (https://github.com/tesonep/Containers-Trie) an implementation of Optimized Tries.

  - [Aleph](https://github.com/estebanlm/aleph) an index system to provide better queries for Spotter and all the users 
  of system navigation. It includes two different implementation, one using a dictionary and the other using a Optimized 
  Trie.

  - [VM Tunning](https://github.com/tesonep/pharo-vm-tunning) a tool to tune the Garbage Collection of the VM during the
  execution of the index generation. This is required to have correct usage of memory and generate the indexes in a short
  time.

  - [Spotter](https://github.com/tesonep/spotter) an iteration on the processor model of GTSpotter adding new processors
  that uses a set of composable iterator to perform the queries incrementally. Also this implementation has the integration
  with the indexes generated by Aleph.

2. It performs a series of settings to improve the behavior of the image:

  - Disables the rendering of incomplete selectors and variables. This improves the speed of the syntax coloring, as it 
  does not require to iterate the whole symbol table.

# Instalation 

The installation is as easy as installing the following baseline:

```
Metacello new
	baseline: 'LargeImageSupport';
	repository: 'github://tesonep/largeImages/src';
	onConflictUseIncoming;
	load
```  

This baseline installs all the tools and configure them, it also configures the image to apply the settings and executes 
the initial process of index creation. This process is only needed after the installation and it takes 3 minutes for an 
image with a ~1.500.000 methods and ~95.000 classes. This image is about 2.5 gb in disk.

# Memory footprint

The memory footprint depends on the nature of the indexed image. For the previously described image the impact 
is around ~400 MB. Different experiments shows a penalty of 20%, although it will depend of the ammount of symbols,
classes and methods. And also how these methods interact with each other specially for senders and references.
Other important differenciating element is the string distribution of the selectors and how much they have in common.
